# Document Automation connector examples

## Intro

This repository is a continous work that will contain snippets and guides to allow the integration between various systems and services with the SkabelonDesign DocumentAutomation API. Our API provides a template black box that can transform datasets and templates into finished documents ready for further distribution or storage in document management systems. The templates are configured using bindings that dynamically resolve based on the dataset recieved. The API can be utilized as a cloud service or as a self-hosted on-premise service.

# Testing the API
